# About This Repository

This repository belongs to my "React Router v6 Upgrade Guide" YouTube [video](...).

You can also learn all about React (incl. React Router) in my ["React - The Complete Guide" course](https://acad.link/reactjs).

The code in this repository is organized into different branches that represent different demo apps and code snapshots (used in the video linked above). You find `-v5` and `-v6` branches which represent the code for these two different versions of React Router.

Also check out the official [docs](https://reactrouter.com/) and the official [v5 => v6 upgrade guide](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5).

# How To Use

The code is primarily meant to be used for comparison (i.e. you compare your code with mine). You can of course also download or clone the repository though. If you do that, you can `npm install` all dependencies and start the development server via `npm start`.
